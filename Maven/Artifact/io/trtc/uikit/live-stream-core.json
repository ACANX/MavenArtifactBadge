  "description": "Live stream core components offer a bunch of powerful APIs. You can preview your screen before going live, start and stop broadcasts seamlessly, interact with viewers in the live room, and even connect with other hosts across different rooms. With our components, you can get the core live streaming process up and running in just 30 minutes. After that, you can simply layer on your custom business UI on top of it.",
