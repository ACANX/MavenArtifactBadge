  "description": "This is a tool that uses java object-oriented idea to write and generate SQL statements. On this basis,\n        it also implements lightweight plug-in support similar to JPA for mybatis and spring JDBC. A large number of\n        common SQL execution methods are built in plug-ins to improve development efficiency, reduce a large number of\n        SQL statement writing, and make developers focus on business code writing.",
