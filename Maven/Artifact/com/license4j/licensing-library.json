  "description": "The LICENSE4J Licensing Library is a comprehensive API designed for seamless software licensing and distribution. It significantly streamlines the entire licensing process for developers, allowing easy integration of robust licensing features into any Java software product with minimal coding. This boosts the efficiency of your software licensing and distribution workflows. The library is used to validate both node-locked and floating licenses on either SaaS or On-Premises License Servers, supporting a wide array of licensing models including perpetual, trial, expiring time-limited, floating, node-locked, subscription, named-user, and feature-based. It also includes advanced routines for detecting device fingerprints from hardware details and robust routines for reading and loading license files or registry entries.",
